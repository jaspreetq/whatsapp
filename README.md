# Whatsapp Clone

This project was accomplished by me: Jaspreet from two different GitHub accounts jaspreetcodes and jaspreetchicmic. The latter account was deleted which is why I forked the recent version on this account. 

This web app allows users to register with verified emails, bypassing WhatsApp's contact list requirement. As it is developed individually within budget constraints, it can handle a limited number of user requests of 40,000 per day. 
However, it ensures secure user authorization and offers features like one-on-one/group chats, profile updates, message notifications, and attachments, resembling WhatsApp's UI.
Tech stack: ReactJs, Firebase, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap. To open the live web app go here: https://jaspreets-whatsapp-clone.netlify.app/
